  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Baked Fish Fillets with Leek Blanket</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 fish fillets (such as cod, haddock, or tilapia)</li>
    <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Fresh herbs (such as thyme or parsley), for garnish (optional)</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a baking dish large enough to hold the fish fillets in a single layer.</li>
    <li>Rinse the fish fillets and pat them dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>In a skillet, melt the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and cook until they soften and become translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Spread a layer of the cooked leeks evenly on the bottom of the greased baking dish.</li>
    <li>Place the seasoned fish fillets on top of the bed of leeks.</li>
    <li>Spread the remaining cooked leeks over the fish fillets, creating a "blanket" of leeks.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.</li>
    <li>Remove the foil and switch the oven to broil. Broil the dish for an additional 2-3 minutes to lightly brown the top of the leek blanket.</li>
    <li>Carefully transfer the baked fish fillets with leeks to serving plates. Garnish with fresh herbs, if desired, and serve with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
    <li>Enjoy your delicious baked fish fillets with leek blanket!</li>
